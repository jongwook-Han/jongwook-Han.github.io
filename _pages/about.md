I'm a PhD student at Seoul National University, Graduate School of Data Science, where I am advised by <a href="https://yohanjo.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Yohan Jo</a>. I'm interested in value-alignment in LLMs, and mechanistic interpretability. I received a M.S in Electrical Engineering from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and a B.S in Integrated Technology from Yonsei University.
